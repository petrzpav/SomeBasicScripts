## Some basic scripts
There are nothing special, just some helpful scripts that I'm using

**RPiUpCheck.sh:** Script for logging (to bash variable, because of SD writes limitation) if second RPi is up. If it's down, I will receive mail.

**PullAll.sh:** Script for pulling all project in my ../git folder

**ReinitializeGit.sh** Script for reinitialization git project (mainly delete old commits)
