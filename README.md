## Some basic scripts
There are nothing special, just some helpful scripts that I'm using

**RPiUpCheck.sh:** Script for logging (to bash variable, because of SD writes limitation) if second RPi is up. If it's down, I will receive mail.



**PullAll.sh:** Script for pulling all project in my ~/git folder



**Extract.sh:** Script for generating install script to installing packages same as in your PC (add same PPA's and manually installed packages into it)
